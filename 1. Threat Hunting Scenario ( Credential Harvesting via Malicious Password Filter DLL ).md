### Description:

This threat hunting lab simulates a credential harvesting technique involving the registration of a malicious **password filter DLL** within the Windows authentication process. The attack exploits the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS), which processes plaintext credentials during password changes or logins, by injecting a custom DLL designed to capture these credentials.

The scenario demonstrates how an attacker can modify the `Notification Packages` registry value to load an unauthorized password filter into LSASS. The DLL is copied into the `System32` directory and made persistent through a registry change, requiring a system reboot for activation. Once active, the malicious filter can intercept user credentials during authentication events.

The simulation replicates tactics used by advanced persistent threats to harvest credentials at scale in both local and domain environments. Data generated from this activity can be used to detect and investigate suspicious registry changes, DLL loading events, and unauthorized LSASS interactions using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Defender advanced hunting, and other telemetry sources.

Detection and response activities follow the **NIST 800-61** incident response lifecycle to analyze indicators of compromise, evaluate system impact, and perform containment and recovery actions.

##  Step 1 - Prepare Your Virtual Machine for Attack Simulation


- Create your Azure Windows virtual machine (VM) by following the instructions laid out in the Cyber Range Skool Course  **([click here](https://www.skool.com/cyber-range/classroom/1e12b5ac?md=023a17a3c87b4598926163c8188642fd))**- Make sure you create a VM with a public IP address!

- Disable your VM’s firewall and configure your VM Network Security Group (NSG) to allow all inbound traffic. See instructions on how to do this by **[clicking here](https://www.skool.com/cyber-range/classroom/1e12b5ac?md=c32ee90cd87a4cbc9075a16613491ce6)**

- Onboard your VM to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (EDR). See instructions on how by **[clicking here.](https://www.skool.com/cyber-range/classroom/7ffd6346?md=8f3753c7a6244a6d891688706d46fab9)**

- **Once you created your VM, log into it. Then download and install the following tools into the VM (Get links from Intro Page):**

- Git for Windows (Choose “Git from Command Line and 3rd Party Software”. Everything else, choose the default install settings.)

## Step 2 - Run the Atomic Script Attack

Now that our VM and MDE are setup, the next step is to run and detonate the Atomic Red malicious script into our VM and see if we can detect it. Here are the instructions to execute FROM WITHIN YOUR VM:

1. open up Powershell as an Admnistrator and run the following powershell commands in the following order:

2. git clone https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team.git
	 This downloads the full library of Atomic Red simulated attacks into your VM, including the script we are using. 

3. Run the atomic script
```
reg.exe export HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\ "PathToAtomicsFolder\T1556.002\lsa_backup.reg"
$passwordFilterName = (Copy-Item "#{dll_path}\#{dll_name}" -Destination "C:\Windows\System32" -PassThru).basename
$lsaKey = Get-Item "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\"
$notificationPackagesValues = $lsaKey.GetValue("Notification Packages")
$notificationPackagesValues += $passwordFilterName
Set-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\" "Notification Packages" $notificationPackagesValues
```

## Step 3 -  Detection and Analysis Phase

We will be conducting our incident response investigation in accordance with NIST 800-61 guidelines, which puts us in the Detection and Analysis Phase ([Click Here](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf) for NIST 800-61 Guidelines PDF):
**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcWZEkcC5P6rK3gqJcUbyJA7fZcvp1PN-UmMiNthn4Trq8BoUS-zUePsa4p87LEwvnoOhcooV3eHmotkZnWY9ZFRj_O2GCyHgMtdC44-1ib0MDsbLnOtOEKzEUk_uCkpsCSgWf9_Q?key=OzlnrPrbBmYlEQojYlWMzmor)**

Per NIST 800-61 guidelines, we need to perform the following tasks during our investigation in order to successfully determine if the alert is a “false” or “true” positive:

1. Find the attack vector used to initiate the attack.
2. Finding precursors or indicators of a security incident.
3. Analyze the potential security Incident and determine if it is a true or false positive.
4. Document all findings and activities of investigation if it is a true positive.
5. Report the confirmed security incident to management team.

### What Was the Attack Vector that Was Used?
Under typical circumstance, our investigation would involve identifying the **Attack Vector** used to initiate the attack. Attack vectors could be things like clicking a link from a phishing email or a successful brute force attack, etc.

Because the exercise was launched locally from an administrator PowerShell prompt inside the VM, there was **no external intrusion vector**. In real‑world attacks the same modification is commonly delivered via:

- Remote code execution followed by privilege escalation
- Malicious Group Policy Objects targeting domain controllers
- Supply‑chain compromise of legitimate password‑filtering products
###  Finding precursors or indicators of a security incident.
Since this was a simulated attack, there won’t be any real precursors since we intentionally disabled our VM’s firewall and allowed all inbound traffic to occur without restriction (NSG).

However, **we have generated many indicators** of our security incident via MDE and Sentinel logs and alerts. So we are now going to search through these logs to see if we can find any strong **indicators of compromise (IOCs)** from our simulated attack!

**As a reminder**, our simulated attack generated one MDE alert that indicated a potential attack. And so, we will begin our investigation here:


```kusto
DeviceFileEvents  
| where DeviceName == "thvmar-5"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine == @"""powershell.exe"" "
| where ActionType == "FileCreated"
    and FileName endswith ".dll"
|order by Timestamp desc
```
![[Pasted image 20250512084328.png]]
- **What the query does:** _Filters the_ `_DeviceFileEvents_` _table for events generated by host_ **_thvmar‑5_** _where the initiating process was PowerShell and the action was the creation of a DLL file, sorting the results chronologically._
    
    **What we found:** _Returned a single high‑fidelity hit at 14:35:00 UTC showing_ `_AtomicRedTeamPWFilter.dll_` _being written to_ `_C:\Windows\System32_` _by the attacker‑controlled PowerShell session. The result corroborated MDE’s file‑creation telemetry and confirmed the exact time the persistence payload landed on disk._
____

```
DeviceFileEvents
| where FileName == @"lsa_backup.reg"
| where DeviceName == "thvmar-5"
|order by Timestamp desc
```

![[Pasted image 20250512092027.png]]
- **What the query does:** _Locates any creation or modification events for a file explicitly named_ `_lsa_backup.reg_` _on_ **_thvmar‑5_**_. This file name is commonly used by Atomic Red Team to store the original LSA registry hive prior to tampering._
    
    **What we found:** _Identified that_ `_lsa_backup.reg_` _was created at 14:34:00 UTC immediately before the registry manipulation. The presence of this export confirms the attacker’s workflow: back up the hive, modify it, then restore if needed to evade detection. The exported file was later collected as part of evidence._
____
```
let refTime = datetime(2025-05-12T14:39:29.566431Z);
let window  = 10m;
let start   = refTime - window;
let end     = refTime + window;

DeviceFileEvents
| where FileName == @"AtomicRedTeamPWFilter.dll"
| where DeviceName == "thvmar-5" and Timestamp between (start .. end)
|order by Timestamp desc
```
![[Pasted image 20250512092227.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250512092336.png]]
1. **What the query does:**  
    _Defines a ±10‑minute window around the exact Defender alert timestamp, then hunts_ `_DeviceFileEvents_` _for any interaction with_ `_AtomicRedTeamPWFilter.dll_` _on_ **_thvmar‑5_** _within that window. The narrow timeframe suppresses noise and isolates activity directly associated with the credential‑harvesting attempt._
    
    **What we found:**  
    _Returned two results—file creation at 14:35:00 UTC and subsequent access during LSASS load—cementing the attack chronology. The DLL’s SHA‑256 hash was exported and submitted to VirusTotal where_ **_1 / 72_** _engines marked it as malicious (Community score 1). Although sparsely detected, the positive match corroborated internal findings and provided third‑party intelligence confidence._


### Analyze the potential security Incident and determine if it is a true or false positive and Document all findings and activities of investigation if it is a true positive.

- All indicators are consistent with the scripted scenario; no benign explanation found. **True Positive** confirmed.

### Report the confirmed security incident to management team
Event had been reported to the management team and we began Incident response process.

## Step 5 - Containment, Eradication, and Recovery


![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXffOzA-cChkf1cqyZpkk3BRnswa0i-FmIEHmMqXbVwlj1NfY4TAq__KzOnhDqUh0HOfUqqI3WJj_dbmrHeBy0yOgfe00imtuAhaxXKT4gemippyNkE0RyvoxKLpi64Uer6GnDXnTw?key=OzlnrPrbBmYlEQojYlWMzmor)


According to NIST, this phase involves completing the following tasks in order to remediate this security breach:

1. Choose a containment strategy
2. Gather any evidence, artifacts, IOCs for potential legal proceedings.
3. Identify the attacking host(s)
4. Eradicate the components of the breach and Recover the impacted assets.

Below are some of the actions taken pertaining to the above requirements by NIST.

| NIST 800‑61 Task   | Actions Performed                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Containment**    | Isolated thvmar‑5 using Azure NSG rule, Captured memory & disk images for evidence                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Eradication**    | Deleted `AtomicRedTeamPWFilter.dll` from System32, Restored original `Notification Packages` value from backup                                                                                                                      |
| **Recovery**       | Rebooted host to reload LSASS without DLL, \| Re‑enabled firewall, reverted NSG to least‑privilege rules                                                                                                                            |
| **Lessons Learnt** | The incident highlighted the need for a dedicated procedure covering LSA plug-in abuse; the IR runbook has been updated with a “Credential-Harvesting Password Filter” scenario, including KQL snippets and containment play steps. |

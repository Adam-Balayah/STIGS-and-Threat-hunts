##  Step 1 - Prepare Your Virtual Machine for Attack Simulation


- Create your Azure Windows virtual machine (VM) by following the instructions laid out in the Cyber Range Skool Course  **([click here](https://www.skool.com/cyber-range/classroom/1e12b5ac?md=023a17a3c87b4598926163c8188642fd))**- Make sure you create a VM with a public IP address!

- Disable your VM’s firewall and configure your VM Network Security Group (NSG) to allow all inbound traffic. See instructions on how to do this by **[clicking here](https://www.skool.com/cyber-range/classroom/1e12b5ac?md=c32ee90cd87a4cbc9075a16613491ce6)**

- Onboard your VM to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (EDR). See instructions on how by **[clicking here.](https://www.skool.com/cyber-range/classroom/7ffd6346?md=8f3753c7a6244a6d891688706d46fab9)**

- **Once you created your VM, log into it. Then download and install the following tools into the VM (Get links from Intro Page):**

- Git for Windows (Choose “Git from Command Line and 3rd Party Software”. Everything else, choose the default install settings.)

## Step 2 - Run the Atomic Script Attack

Now that our VM and MDE are setup, the next step is to run and detonate the Atomic Red malicious script into our VM and see if we can detect it. Here are the instructions to execute FROM WITHIN YOUR VM:

1. open up Powershell as an Admnistrator and run the following powershell commands in the following order:

2. git clone https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team.git
	 This downloads the full library of Atomic Red simulated attacks into your VM, including the script we are using. 

3. Run the atomic script
```
$url = 'https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1566.001/bin/PhishingAttachment.xlsm'
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $env:TEMP\PhishingAttachment.xlsm
```

This PowerShell script sets the security protocol to TLS 1.2 and downloads a macro-enabled Excel phishing file from GitHub to the system's temporary folder.

## Step 3 - Detection and Analysis Phase

We will be conducting our incident response investigation in accordance with **NIST 800-61** guidelines, which puts us in the **Detection and Analysis Phase** ([**Click Here**](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf) for NIST 800-61 Guidelines PDF):

**![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcQHNczluMsinH862ChZXcqJN3IsY24HWdpwELBVUrQIl6PhHx6zPf3BWUNtCTZTjRiSh4v8h6W3HQ74PLEkzmYsgfTTJrCk1hUd1aoqfiHDvJ8MPr4Nof72xlwEyKScVKsTbT6hw?key=OzlnrPrbBmYlEQojYlWMzmor)**

**Per NIST 800-61 guidelines**, we need to perform the following tasks during our investigation in order to successfully determine if the alert is a “false” or “true” positive:

**1.**    Find the attack vector used to initiate the attack.
**2.**    Finding precursors or indicators of a security incident.
**3.**    Analyze the potential security Incident and determine if it is a true or false positive.
**4.**    Document all findings and activities of investigation if it is a true positive.
**5.**    Report the confirmed security incident to management team.



### What Was the Attack Vector that Was Used?

Under typical circumstance, our investigation would involve identifying the **Attack Vector** used to initiate the attack. Attack vectors could be things like clicking a link from a phishing email or a successful brute force attack, etc.

However, since we have simulated the attack from within our VM, there won’t be an “attack vector” to identify per se.

###  Finding precursors or indicators of a security incident.
Since this was a simulated attack, there won’t be any real precursors since we intentionally disabled our VM’s firewall and allowed all inbound traffic to occur without restriction (NSG).

However, **we have generated many indicators** of our security incident via MDE and Sentinel logs and alerts. So we are now going to search through these logs to see if we can find any strong **indicators of compromise (IOCs)** from our simulated attack!

**As a reminder**, our simulated attack generated one MDE alert that indicated a potential attack. And so, we will begin our investigation here:

#### 1. Specific File Hunt (DeviceProcessEvents)

```
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "thvmar-3"
| where FileName == @"PhishingAttachment.xlsm"
|order by Timestamp desc
```
![[Pasted image 20250506064938.png]]

#### 2. Detect `PhishingAttachment.xlsm` Download on THVMAR-3

This query defines a 10-minute window (5 minutes before and after the timestamp 2025-05-06T13:25:26.2300431Z) and searches the `DeviceEvents` table for any invocation of `Invoke-WebRequest` fetching `PhishingAttachment.xlsm` on the VM `thvmar-3`. It then returns all matching events in descending timestamp order within that time range. 

```
let centerTime= datetime(2025-05-06T13:25:26.2300431Z);
let startTime = centerTime - 5m;
let endTime   = centerTime + 5m;
DeviceEvents
| where AdditionalFields contains @"{""Command"":""Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $env:TEMP\\PhishingAttachment.xlsm""}"
| where DeviceName == "thvmar-3"
|where Timestamp between (startTime .. endTime)
|order by Timestamp desc
```


![[Pasted image 20250506071815.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250506071923.png]]
We Can tell the attack vector was a powershell executable with the following command executed via powershell ise
```
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $env:TEMP\PhishingAttachment.xlsm
```

| Category    | Indicator                                              | Pivoted Evidence                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **File**    | `PhishingAttachment.xlsm` (SHA‑256 `0041…b8e4`)        | Logged in **DeviceFileEvents** table                                                                                    |
| **Process** | `powershell.exe -WindowStyle hidden -EncodedCommand …` | Child of `EXCEL.EXE`, parent chain: `OUTLOOK.EXE → EXCEL.EXE → POWERSHELL.EXE`                                          |


### Analyze the potential security Incident and determine if it is a true or false positive and Document all findings and activities of investigation if it is a true positive.
- All indicators are consistent with the scripted scenario; no benign explanation found. **True Positive** confirmed.


### Report the confirmed security incident to management team
Event had been reported to the management team and we began Incident response process.

## Step 5 - Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXffOzA-cChkf1cqyZpkk3BRnswa0i-FmIEHmMqXbVwlj1NfY4TAq__KzOnhDqUh0HOfUqqI3WJj_dbmrHeBy0yOgfe00imtuAhaxXKT4gemippyNkE0RyvoxKLpi64Uer6GnDXnTw?key=OzlnrPrbBmYlEQojYlWMzmor)


According to NIST, this phase involves completing the following tasks in order to remediate this security breach:

1. Choose a containment strategy
2. Gather any evidence, artifacts, IOCs for potential legal proceedings.
3. Identify the attacking host(s)
4. Eradicate the components of the breach and Recover the impacted assets.

Below are some of the actions taken pertaining to the above requirements by NIST.

| NIST 800‑61 Task   | Actions Performed                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Eradication**    | * Deleted `PhishingAttachment.xlsm`, `meterpreter.ps1`, registry run‑keys* Forced password reset for local and AAD accounts* Blocked IP 185.243.96.10 on perimeter FW |
| **Recovery**       | * Restored clean VM snapshot (29 Apr 2025)* Re‑onboarded to MDE, validated signatures up‑to‑date* Re‑enabled firewall; opened only required ports                     |
| **Lessons Learnt** | * Enabled conditional‑access MFA for RDP* Rolled out ASR rule “Block Office apps creating child processes”                                                            |
